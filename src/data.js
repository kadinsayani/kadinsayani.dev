    conceptWriteup:
      "Context: In this game, children become nature explorers who can learn about and interact with different species in a virtual forest. It combines education and entertainment, teaching kids about various species in an ecosystem and how the population of different species interact with each other. (1) Virtual Forest Scene: Create a virtual forest background. Add trees, bushes, and the sky. (2) Immersive Sound: Incorporate background sounds of birds chirping to enhance the forest's atmosphere. This will engage children's auditory senses, making the experience more immersive. (3) Replicate an ecosystem: Replicate the ecosystem of an Albertan forest on the screen, which will include a grey wolf, white tail deer, migrating blue jays, spruce trees, northern red oak trees, and redcurrant plants. (4) Interact with the objects on the screen: Provide a way for children to be able to interact with the objects on the screen. Method 1 (most promising) - Hover and Click: Highlight objects that are clickable with an outline when you hover over them (to indicate to kids that this is a clickable object). Method 2 - Draggable element: Shape the cursor like a catcher's net that children can move around by dragging it across the screen to catch the animals. Limitation: Not all the objects are animals, some of them may be trees, birds and plants ‚Äì which can confuse children because they may not think the other objects can be clicked on. Method 3 - Drawing a circle around the object. Limitation: Only feasible if using a touchscreen device. With non-touchscreen devices, it will be a lot harder for children to draw a circle around an object using a touchpad or a mouse. (5) Educational Pop-ups: Clicking on an object opens a pop-up window which displays interesting facts about the species they clicked on ‚Äì as a way to educate them. (6) Closing the Educational Pop-ups. Method 1 - Timeout: Pop-up windows close automatically after a specific time. However, this approach may not suit children with varying reading speeds. Method 2 (most promising ) ‚Äì Close Button: A prominent red \"X\" in the corner of the pop-up window allows children to close it at their own pace, ensuring they have ample time to absorb the information. This also follows the usual convention that they are most likely familiar with. (7) Special Sounds for Pop-up Events: To further engage children, special sounds accompany the opening and closing of pop-up windows, adding an element of interactivity and delight to the game. (8) Tracking Progress: A progress bar at the top of the screen will indicate the number of objects yet to be discovered. The goal is to find all the objects, and being able to see their progress will motivate children to explore and learn more. (9) Completion of the Game: Once all objects have been found, a final pop-up window congratulates the player for successfully completing the task and winning the game, providing a sense of accomplishment. (10) Interactive Species Population: Have sliders labelled for each species that will enable children to adjust population sizes, revealing how changes affect the interactions among species within the ecosystem, promoting understanding and learning.",
